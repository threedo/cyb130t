'''
Write a program whose input is two integers. Output the first integer and subsequent increments of 5 as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:

-15
10
the output is:

-15 -10 -5 0 5 10
Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:

20
5
the output is:

Second integer can't be less than the first.
For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last.
'''

x = int(input())
y = int(input())

if y >= x:
    for i in range(x, y+1, 5,):
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
else:
    print('Second integer can\'t be less than the first.')
